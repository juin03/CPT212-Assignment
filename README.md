# CPT212 Assignment 1 - README

This repository contains three Java files and a complete dataset for the CPT212 Assignment 1.

## Java Files

1. **DatasetGenerator.java**: This file is used to generate a set of new multiplicands and multipliers from n=1 to n=100, along with the expected result.

2. **Part1LongMultiplication.java**: This file generates the primitive operations of the simple multiplication algorithm.

3. **Part2Karatsuba.java**: This file generates the primitive operations of the Karatsuba algorithm.

To obtain the complete dataset, follow the sequence from 1 to 2 to 3. Each file builds upon the previous one to provide a full set of data.

## Complete Dataset

A file named **CompleteDataset.csv** is prepared, which contains the completed results. It includes all the primitive operations and results for both Part 1 and Part 2. You can use this dataset for analysis or further processing.

Please refer to the individual Java files for more details on their usage and implementation.
